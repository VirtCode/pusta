Welcome to the Pusta documentation! Here you'll find all sorts of information about pusta and how to use it. Every feature and function is fully documented here.

The documentation is split into three sections:
- **Structure your Config** - This is the most useful section. It contains all information needed to structure your config to work with pusta. It explains all jobs, module and repository properties, and other features you can leverage to improve your configuration.
- **Working with Pusta** - This section contains information for how to work with Pusta. This mainly includes the commands which are used to manipulate your modules and work with your config.
- **Customizing Pusta** - In this section you can learn about how to customize pusta to your needs, mainly about how to configure it.

Use the sidebar of the wiki to navigate to these sections.

### New Here?
Have a look at the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page, which will introduce you to the core concepts of pusta and shows you how to create your first module.

## Other resources
There also are some other resources besides this wiki which you can look at:
- [Issue Tracker](../issues) - Have look at the issue tracker if you wonder about the state of a certain feature or encounter some bugs.
- Example (soon) - Look at the example dotfiles repository for an example of how to use Pusta on a bigger scale.
